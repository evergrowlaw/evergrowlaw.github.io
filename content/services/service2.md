We are dedicated to supporting the vital work of mission-driven organizations. Understanding that nonprofits face a unique set of legal and operational challenges, we provide tailored counsel to help you navigate the complexities of formation, compliance, and governance. Our goal is to build a durable legal foundation so you can focus on what matters most: achieving your mission and making a positive impact.

### Formation and Tax Exemption
The path to establishing a fully recognized, tax-exempt organization is intricate. We manage the entire process with precision to ensure you start on solid legal ground.
* **Entity Formation:** Guiding founders in the formation of nonprofit corporations, including drafting specialized Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws that meet both state and federal requirements for tax exemption.
* **Application for Tax-Exempt Status:** Preparing and filing the comprehensive Application for Recognition of Exemption (IRS Form 1023 series) to obtain federal tax-exempt status under Internal Revenue Code Section 501(c)(3).
* **Strategic Classification:** Advising on the important distinction between public charity and private foundation status and structuring the organization to achieve the desired classification from the outset.

### Governance and Board Advisory
Effective and ethical governance is the cornerstone of a nonprofit’s success and public trust. We provide boards with the tools and guidance they need to lead effectively and fulfill their fiduciary duties.
* **Governance Design:** Designing robust governance structures and drafting key policies essential for nonprofit best practices, including Conflict of Interest, Whistleblower, and Document Retention policies.
* **Board of Directors Counsel:** Advising the board on their fiduciary duties of care, loyalty, and obedience, and providing guidance on running effective meetings, maintaining proper minutes, and managing director responsibilities.
* **Bylaw Review and Updates:** Assisting established organizations in reviewing and amending their bylaws to reflect their current operations and to comply with evolving laws.

### Regulatory Compliance and Operations
Maintaining tax-exempt status requires diligent adherence to a complex web of ongoing regulations. We help you manage these obligations efficiently so you can avoid penalties and protect your standing.
* **Ongoing Compliance:** Managing annual state and federal reporting requirements, including providing guidance for the preparation of the IRS Form 990.
* **Fundraising and Solicitation:** Assisting with state-specific charitable solicitation registration and compliance for organizations that fundraise nationally.
* **Operational Counsel:** Providing guidance on complex operational issues, such as Unrelated Business Income Tax (UBIT), grant agreements, lobbying and advocacy rules, and reviewing contracts to minimize liability.
