We act as a strategic partner to our clients, moving beyond simple entity formation to build a robust legal architecture designed for scalability, investment, and long-term success. Our services are tailored to support sustainable growth and proactive risk management through every stage of the business lifecycle.

### Company Formation and Structuring

A solid foundation is critical. We guide founders through the crucial decisions made at inception to ensure the company is structured for future success.

* **Strategic Entity Selection:** Advising on the optimal legal entity (e.g., C-Corporation, LLC) to align with your business model, tax considerations, and fundraising goals.
* **Incorporation and Qualification:** Preparing and filing all necessary formation documents with the relevant state authorities and handling foreign qualifications for operating in other states.
* **Founder Agreements:** Drafting foundational documents, including Founder Stock Purchase Agreements with customized vesting schedules to protect the company and align founder interests.

### Corporate Governance and Compliance

Strong governance is the bedrock of a healthy, scalable company. We establish clear frameworks and manage ongoing compliance to ensure your business operates smoothly and maintains its legal good standing.

* **Governing Documents:** Crafting customized Bylaws (for corporations) and Operating Agreements (for LLCs) that define the rules of governance and the rights of stakeholders.
* **Board and Shareholder Management:** Advising boards of directors on fiduciary duties, managing board and shareholder consents, and maintaining official corporate records and minute books.
* **Ongoing Compliance:** Handling mandatory annual state filings and providing proactive counsel on regulatory changes to ensure your company remains compliant with all legal requirements, thereby protecting its liability shield.

### Equity Arrangements and Capitalization Management

Equity is the primary currency for startups. We provide expert guidance on all aspects of equity compensation and capitalization to help you attract talent and manage your ownership structure effectively.
* **Equity Incentive Plans:** Designing, implementing, and managing employee stock option plans (ESOPs) and other equity awards to attract, motivate, and retain top talent.
* **Capitalization Table (Cap Table) Management:** Maintaining an accurate and organized record of your company’s ownership structure through all stages of financing and equity grants.
* **Stock Administration:** Handling the mechanics of stock issuance, transfers, and repurchases in compliance with securities laws.

### Complex Contractual Frameworks

We develop and negotiate the essential agreements that govern the relationships between the company and its key stakeholders, ensuring clarity and preventing future disputes.
* **Shareholder Agreements:** Structuring comprehensive agreements among shareholders that govern voting rights, transfer restrictions, and other critical matters.
* **Buy-Sell Agreements:** Creating clear mechanisms for the orderly transfer of ownership upon the occurrence of specified trigger events, such as the departure of a founder.
* **Strategic Contracts:** Advising on other foundational corporate contracts that support the company’s strategic objectives and internal governance.
